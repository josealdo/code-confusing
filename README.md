# Decoding Confusing Code: Social Representations among Developers

## Overview

Confusing  code   is   the   phenomenon   in which software developers have considerable difficulties in reaching proper program comprehension. These difficulties may result from  plenty  of  characteristics  of  the  source  code  and  externalissues. In this way, there is still a lack of knowledge on the core issues addressing confusing code. This knowledge is important for companies optimizing efforts in promoting program comprehension. In this paper, we investigate the social representations of confusing code among two distinct communities of developers from the Brazilian software industry. We conducted free association  tasks  with  the  developers  to  characterize  what  is  intheir minds about confusing code. Then, we compiled the set of associations that compose the social representations of confusing code  in  each  community.  We  found  that  developers strongly  associate  confusing  code  with  a  core  set  of  undesirable characteristics  of  the  source  code,  such  as  different  types  ofcode smells and bad names for code elements. Besides, we found that  these  issues  are  potential  sources  of  discouragement  and conflict  among  developers.  In  this  way,  we  discuss  alternatives for  companies  and  project  teams  overcoming  them.  The  findings  of  our  study  reveal  a  core  set  of  issues  addressing confusing code that developers should continuously prevent and combat.
